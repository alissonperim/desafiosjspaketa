                I had my concerns that due to a tight deadline this project can't be done.
                But Florin proved me wrong not only he delivered an outstanding work but
                he managed to deliver 1 day prior to the deadline. And when I asked for some
                revisions he made them in MINUTES. I'm looking forward to work with him
                again and I totally recommend him. Thanks again Florin!

                Second time hiring him. Finished everything in a timely manner and his work is excellent.
                Can't recommend him enough.

                Alexandru Florin never fails to impress me by the quality of his work and delivering on time.
                When it comes to front-end, he is definitely my go to guy. Always is a pleasure to work with
                Alexandru even when deadlines are tight and pressure is great. It's reassuring to have a
                project in such good hands.
